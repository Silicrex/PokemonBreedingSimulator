# PokemonBreedingSimulator
## What is this?
* Various simulations for Pokemon IV breeding. IVs are hereditary values which have a role in determining the stats of a Pokemon (like points added onto the species' base stats). Each Pokemon has six IVs— one for Health, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. IVs range from 0–31 in value.
## What are the common terms?
* IV = Individual Value
* 6IV, 5IV, etc. = Number corresponds to how many 'perfect' (31) IVs a Pokemon has. 6IV means a perfect Pokemon (maximum possible stats).
* Destiny Knot = Item that causes the offspring to inherit 5 IVs from the parents, as opposed to the normal 3.
## What does each file do?
Each file is its own separate simulation. There are settings to control things like number of trials, offspring gender ratio, destiny knot usage, and target number of 31s.
* **breed_to_iv.py** is for optimally breeding to a certain nIV offspring (offspring with n 31 IVs)
## Disclaimer
* Any errors? Please feel free to reach out! I'm not an expert and did not necessarily code the mechanics in a way that perfectly matches the real in-game process. This project was mostly just for fun, and to get a better understanding of the statistics/strategy involved in competitive breeding.
